#  Cabauw Medusa flask measurements, University of Bristol

This archive contains Cabauw flask measurements made by Angelina Wenger at the University of Bristol. 

The code for processing and standardising these data is at https://github.com/mrghg/agage-archive.

The data come from netCDF files generated by GCWerks, with some minor modifications using the agage-archive code.

The code for reprocessing the data is currently maintained by the University of Bristol. Contact matt.rigby@bristol.ac.uk with errors and questions. For questions regarding individual data sources, please contact the relevant DECC PIs (contact details are contained in file metadata).

# Format and Structure

Filenames follow the convention:

```network{-instrument}_sitecode_species_{filetype-}version.nc```

Where the elements in curly brackets are optional, depending on the file.

Below is an example of the archive structure, showing only CFC-11 for the AGAGE network. Note that some elements may not apply to this dataset (e.g., baseline flags and individual instruments):

At the first level, the archive is organised by species. The files in this top-level directory are the "default" records that should be sufficient for most users. Here, high-frequency can refer to the instantaneous or integrated observations on gas chromatography systems, and/or hourly averages from optical instruments. These files may be a combination of multiple instruments for some species. 

There are sub-directories within each species directory. The ```monthly-baseline``` directory contains monthly mean mole fractions calculated using a pollution algorithm. The individual flags are contained in the ```baseline-flag``` folder. 

The ```individual-instrument``` sub-directory contains files for individual instruments, which may have been combined to for the default files for some species and sites.

# Data Statement:

These data are made available to the scientific community and public to improve understanding of climate change and ozone depletion and to lead to new scientific insights. We rely on the ethics and integrity of the user to ensure that project scientists receive fair credit for their work.

If the data are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, dataset PIs should be informed at the outset of the proposed work. PI contact information is located in the file metadata. If the data are essential to the work, co-authorship on publications may be appropriate. Manuscripts using the data should be sent early to the relevant data contacts for review before they are submitted for publication, so we can ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately represented.

Every effort is made to produce the most accurate and precise measurements possible. However, we reserve the right to make corrections to the data based on recalibration of standard gases or for other reasons deemed scientifically justified. We are not responsible for results and conclusions based on use of these data without regard to this warning.

Data used in publications must be included as a supplementary file with the publication.

# Data Reciprocity Agreement

Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate. Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their own data available to the general public and to the scientific community in an equally complete and easily accessible form. Scientists are encouraged to make available to the community, upon request, their own modelling tools used in the interpretation of the data, namely well documented model code, transport fields, and additional information necessary for other scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.
